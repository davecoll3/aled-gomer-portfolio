                        <p>A very warm welcome to you. As I'm sure you've gathered, my name is Aled. Do read on, if you so please.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I'm primarily an <strong>actor</strong>, but I'm also a <strong>theatre maker, writer</strong> and <strong>facilitator</strong>. I trained at the <strong>Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama</strong> (2023) and graduated with a first in acting - posh! Last year I trained in clowning at <strong>École Philippe Gaulier</strong> (2024), which was kindly funded by the <strong>Carne Trust</strong>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I'm also the recipient of the <strong>Garrick Scholarship</strong> (2022) and the <strong>Carne Trust Scholarship</strong> (2023). Both were awarded for demonstrating considerable acting talent for actors coming from a low socio-economic background.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Since then I have been awarded an <strong>Arts Council of Wales Create Grant</strong> to develop my play <strong><em>Dad, Where's My Rolex?</em></strong> (2024), had my theatrical debut at the <strong>Chichester Festival Theatre</strong> (2024) and voiced the character of a Pink Block in a kids animation for <strong>S4C</strong> (2023). Scroll down for the <strong>Spotlight</strong> if you wanna know more.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I was an <strong>Associate Artist</strong> for <strong>Pentabus Theatre</strong> (2023-24). Pentabus is a wonderful theatre company that tours new writing with rural communities. The work they do is vital. Before this I participated in both the <strong>Local</strong> (2022) and <strong>National</strong> (2023) <strong>Pentabus Young Writers Groups</strong>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>My most profound experiences in theatre have been through the lens of comedy, <strong>clown</strong> and <strong>improvisation</strong>. I'm cultivating both into my growing practice, but there's more to harvest. Where can clown be used in participatory work? How can improvisation help people with addiction? Can devising help older people in our communities? Time to get to work.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I grew up on a council estate in Cardiff and consider myself working-class. It's my culture. I want to show that anyone from this background can engage with and work in the arts if that's what they fancy.</p>
                        <br>    
                        <p>Theatre is my church, it's where we share our stories.</p>

                                <em>Dad, Where’s My Rolex?</em> explores addiction in all its shapes and forms.
                                Basically, my dad was an alcoholic and it turns out a whole load of my
                                distant, far-off relatives up and up the family tree were too. I wanted to
                                explore all that messiness and chaos through a theatrical form.

                            I facilitated a set of <strong>Creative Writing Workshops</strong> for the members of
                            <strong>Recovery Cymru</strong>, alongside my <strong><em>Dad, Where's My Rolex?</em></strong> research
                            and development. Recovery Cymru is an incredible charity that
                            supports people through their recovery journey. I urge you take a look at
                            the brilliant work they do.

                            I have a connection with <strong>PaperTrail</strong>. I took part in their <strong>Creative Steps
                            focus group</strong> to help them discover future opportunities as a company. I
                            then facilitated an <strong>Improvisation Workshop</strong> as part of the outreach
                            that ran alongside their production of <strong><em>A Visit</em></strong>.

                            Recently, I have been collaborating with <strong>Pentabus Theatre</strong> to deliver

                            with primary school kids.

                            I spent many a long year volunteering with the <strong>Scouts Association</strong>,
                            working with young people aged six to ten.

                            Before training at the Royal Welsh College, I volunteered with <strong>Hijinx
                            Theatre Company</strong>. I was supporting <strong>learning disabled actors</strong> in
                            their weekly drama sessions.

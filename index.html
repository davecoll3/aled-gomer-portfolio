                    <p>A very warm welcome to you, as I’m sure you’ve guessed, my name is Aled.</p> 
                    <p>Do read on, if you so please.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I’m primarily an actor, but I also write and make theatre and facilitate in the community.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I trained at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and graduated with a first in acting - posh! 
                        Last year I trained in clowning at École Philippe Gaulier, which was kindly funded by the Carne Trust.

                    <p>
                        I have since been awarded an Arts Council of Wales Create Grant to
                        develop my play Dad, Where’s My Rolex?. Had my theatrical debut at the
                        Chichester Festival Theatre and voiced the character of a Pink Block in a
                        kids Animations on S4C. Scroll down for the Spotlight if you wanna know
                        more.

                    <p>
                        I was an Associate Artist for Pentabus Theatre; Pentabus is a wonderful
                        theatre company that tours new writing with rural communities. The
                        work they do is vital. Before this I participated on both the National and
                        Local Pentabus Young Writers Group’s. They took me seriously as a
                        writer, and in turn I took my writing seriously.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My most profound experiences in theatre have been through the lens of
                        comedy, through clown and improvisation. I’ve began cultivating both
                        into my growing practice, but there’s more to harvest. Where can clown
                        be used in participatory work? How can improvisation help people with
                        addiction? Can devised comedy be used with older people in our
                        communities?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I grew up on a council estate in Cardiff and I consider myself working
                        class. It’s my culture. I want to show that anyone from this background
                        can engage with and work in the arts, if that’s what they fancy.

                    <p>Theatre is my church, it’s where we share our stories.</p>
